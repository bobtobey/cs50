                            <p>
                                Hello, I'm Bob Tobey.
                                Traveling has always been more than just a hobby for me—it's a way to connect with the world, and dive into new experiences.
                                This website is my way of sharing a little bit the unforgettable journey I had during the summer of 2023 in Iceland, a land that truly feels like stepping into another world.
                                From dramatic landscapes to unique culture, Iceland offers something for every adventurer at heart.
                            </p>
                            <div class="article-with-image-wrapper">
                                <div class="article-with-image-text-bloc">
                                    <p>
                                        One of the most breathtaking aspects of Iceland is its waterfalls, and trust me, they are every bit as magical as they look in the photos.
                                        In the south, you'll find Seljalandsfoss, a stunning waterfall you can walk behind—just be prepared to get a little wet!
                                        Nearby is Skógafoss, a majestic cascade with a rainbow often arched over its mist.
                                        For those exploring the Golden Circle, Gullfoss, or "Golden Falls," is a must-see.
                                        Its roaring power and beauty are awe-inspiring, leaving you speechless as you take it all in.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Ring Road was the ultimate gateway to experiencing Iceland's diverse landscapes.
                                        This iconic route takes you from black sand beaches to glaciers, volcanoes, and interesting local fishing towns.
                                        Every turn offers something new, whether it's the vibrant blue icebergs floating in Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon or the serene fjords of the east.
                                        It's the kind of road trip that feels like it's straight out of a dream.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="images/iceland_pic6_mini.jpg" alt="Seljalandsfoss Waterfall in Iceland" class="waterfall-img">
                                    <figcaption>Seljalandsfoss Waterfall - A breathtaking wonder in Iceland</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Of course, no trip to Iceland would be complete without a visit to Thingvellir National Park.
                                This UNESCO World Heritage Site is where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, creating a dramatic rift valley.
                                It's also rich in history, being the site of Iceland's first parliament.
                                Walking through Thingvellir is like stepping back in time, surrounded by the raw beauty of nature.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then there were the Icelandic horses—easily one of my favorite parts of the trip.
                                These small, sturdy horses are incredibly friendly and have a unique gait called the "tölt," which makes them a joy to watch.
                                They're more than just animals; they're part of Iceland's cultural identity, and spending time with them is an experience you'll treasure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I hope this glimpse into my adventure sparks a bit of wanderlust and curiosity.
                            </p>
