QUESTION: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Based on our 2 query questions and what the Audio Aura article mentions:
    SELECT name FROM songs WHERE danceability > 0.75 AND energy > 0.75 AND valence > 0.75;
    SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
I am guessing that Spotify does something similar by calculating the average of all 3 categories (energy, danceability, and valence)
of a persons top 100 songs. Then evalauting where the user's average falls - either above or below 0.50 in the different categories.
Based on where the averages end up Spotify could map them to a particular 'MOOD' or "Aura" scale.

QUESTION 2: Hypothesize about why the way you've calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
Since everyone is unique and the times that they happen to be listening to Spotify may be 
QUESTION 3: What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
