QUESTION: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Based on our 2 query questions and what the Audio Aura article mentions:
    SELECT name FROM songs WHERE danceability > 0.75 AND energy > 0.75 AND valence > 0.75;
    SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
I am guessing that Spotify does something similar by calculating the average of all 3 categories (energy, danceability, and valence)
of a persons top 100 songs. Then evalauting where the user's average falls - either above or below 0.50 in the different categories.
Based on where the averages end up Spotify could map them to a particular 'MOOD' or "Aura" scale.

QUESTION 2: Hypothesize about why the way you've calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
Since everyone is unique and the times that users happen to be listening to Spotify may be when they are in particular moods or situations
already. In that case you may not get an accurate read of how that user's true overall mood or aura is. It could end up giving you their aura
for only the period of time they listen to Spotify the most. Example the user only listens to Spotify at work and that user is usually in a bad mood at work.

QUESTION 3: What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A way to improve this might be to increase your data sample by evaluating the users top 200 songs or more.
Or use it in combination with what artists they listen to the most and map artists to a particular Aura average also?
