QUESTION: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Based on our 2 query questions:
    SELECT name FROM songs WHERE danceability > 0.75 AND energy > 0.75 AND valence > 0.75;
    SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
If we calculated the average of all 3 categories (energy, danceability, and valence) of a persons top 100 songs
